# EmojiScript - A Better List of Emojis
EmojiScript is an AoPS script created by Wukong and Forester2015 in order to give AoPS a wider list of emojis to choose from. The idea of the script is simple; finding a certain string, such as `:pog:`, and replacing it with an `[img]` tag with its respective image; for example, `[img]www.imageURL.com[/img]`.

## Installation
There are only two things you need to use EmojiScript
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (ViolentMonkey works too)
2. Copy & Paste the code from EmojiScript.js into a new Tampermonkey script.
